- 👋 Hi, I’m @all-sins and I like computers!

- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech! From writing PowerShell scripts to Java classes, from creating servers to developing bots and tools such as the one's seen in my repos such as:
            https://github.com/all-sins/ExampleCode - A collection of all kinds of scripts, classes and code from all kinds of languages I've worked with.
            https://github.com/all-sins/getSomeRest - A hackable Java Spring Boot REST application that's designed to be compromised.
            https://github.com/all-sins/jNetGraph - A Java Spring Boot application that passively measures your internet connection with DB and API functionality.
            https://github.com/all-sins/iCute - A Discord utility robot made with Discord4J framework - a reactive Java implementation of the Discord API.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure DevOps, Java, Maven, Gradle, ANT, YAML.

- 💞️ I am not currently looking to colaborate. For now... :)
